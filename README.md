This repository contains two android projects they are 
1. Location Approximator - an application which takes location only once from wifi or gps and updates then using the haversines formula 
2. Friend Finder - an application which finds friends which are near to the user within a distance of 1 km radius. This is built by using AWS as server which runs php scripts and Android studio.
